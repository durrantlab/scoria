The AtomsAndBonds Class
=======================

Rationale of the AtomsAndBonds functions
----------------------------------------

The functions within the AtomsAndBonds framework all involve the
addition, deletion, and manipulation of individual atoms and their
bonds within the molecular framework. 


Other Classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To make modifications to the coordinate set of all atoms, use the
functions within the :class:`~pymolecule.Manipulation` class. To look
at groups of atoms with similar properties, use the functions within
the :class:`~pymolecule.Selections` class.
