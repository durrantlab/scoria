The Molecule Class
===================

Initiating and using the object
-------------------------------

The Molecule object is the main object class within the scoria
module. All other classes (with the exception of the
:class:`~scoria_mda.Quarterion`) are initiated with, and hold the
relevant functions and variables for, the Molecule object. This class
contains wrapper functions to *nearly* every function belonging to
it's children classes.
