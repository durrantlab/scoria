Welcome!
========

This is a quick guide to get you up to speed for documenting python
projects. We use a specific type of documenting style called 'REST' or
reStructuredText, which allows us to autopopulate html pages with our
documentation.

We will want every class and function to have a string documenting
what it is and how it works. A base template to work off of will look
like this::

   def foo(bar, var):
      """
      This is a fuction that foo-ifies a variable, with regards to bar.

      Please note that this is only functioning with version foobar 4.2
      and that earlier versions are not supported.

      :param int bar: This represents the level of bar we want to foo.

      :param str var: This is the string that we will be foo-ifying.

      :returns: foo-ified var with regards to bar.
      :rtype: :class:`str`

      ::

         >>> bar = 4
         >>> var = "Hello World!"
         >>> print foo(bar, var)
         Hello World!Hello World!Hello World!Hello World!
      """

      foovar = foobar.fooify(var * bar)
      return foovar

There are a few things to include with a good documentation string.  

* A short description of the function in plain english, with any
  caveats or non-standard behaviours.

* A note of dependancies or relationships between this code and other
  functions or librarie, if any.

* A list of any parameters that the function takes. These should be
  prefaced with ``:param type name:`` which will be autopopulated when
  the documentation is generated.

* A description of the return value of the function. This should be
  prefaced with ``:returns:``. The variable type that is returned
  should be prefaced with ``:rtype:`` and a link to the object that it
  should return. 

  * Finally an example is sometimes a good way to end a documentation
  section. A literal section of code is created with the ``::`` as
  either a stand alone will allow you to enter a quick example of the
  function.

These segments are almost all optional. If a function doesn't take
parameters, or give a return value, then the documentation shouldn't
cover it. Likewise, if there are no dependancies or necessary
examples, then those sections should be omitted.

An example of an alternate layout would be a setter function as
follows::

   def set_namespace(self, namespace):
      """
      Sets the namespace for the function. 
 
      :param str namespace: A string containing the new namespace.
      """
      
      self.__namespace = namespace
