The Geometry class
==========================

Rationale of the Geometry functions
-----------------------------------

The functions in the Geometry class calculate different advanced geometric 
features of the molecule, given certain points as input.

Other Classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Geometry functions rely on the input of coordinate arrays which can be
obtained from the :meth:`~scoria_mda.Information.Information.get_coordinates`
function. Note that the geometry functions work whether the coordinates exist
as atoms in the molecule or not.
